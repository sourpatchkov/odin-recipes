        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <il>Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, place hot dog in water, and cook until 
                warmed through, about 5 minutes. Remove hot dog from water and set aside.</il>

            <il>Place a steamer basket into the pot and steam poppy seed bun until warm, about 2 minutes.</il>
       
             <il>Place hot dog in steamed bun. Pile on toppings in this order: mustard, relish, onion, tomato, pickle, peppers, and celery salt. The tomato wedges should be nestled between hot dog and top of bun on one side. Place pickle between hot dog 
                and bottom of bun on the other side. Don't even think about ketchup!</il>
